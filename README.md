Hello! I'm a seasoned web developer with a strong foundation in Python and JavaScript. Specializing in backend development with Django, I craft scalable and efficient REST APIs, adhering to the DRY principle to ensure clean and maintainable code. On the frontend, I leverage the latest features of SvelteKit to create responsive and dynamic user experiences. With a keen interest in DevOps, I integrate tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines to streamline development and deployment processes, making sure that the platforms I work on are robust and performant. Let's build something amazing together!
